    DOM
        - I was able to get DOM nodes but found it hard to change text values in nodes. I need write some simple JS that selects DOM nodes and reads text or html attributes. To start with, I plan to watch some recap videos and re-read my old code, both linked below. I will practise in the file: "dom.js"

    Fetch
        - I think I'm confusing the difference between fetch and using express. I need to recap the difference and make sure I'm comfortable with when to use each one. I will start my learning by watching some recap videos, and again, re-reading old code (linked below).

    Async / Await:
        - I understand the concept of async/await, but I struggled to know when it was needed. I know how it works (such as placing await before a promise inside an async function. It makes the code wait for the promise to resolve and returns the resolved value), but I find it hard to remember which functions I'm required to use it with.
