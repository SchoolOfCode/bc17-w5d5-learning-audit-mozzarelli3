    DOM
        - I was able to get DOM nodes but found it hard to change text values in nodes. I need write some simple JS that selects DOM nodes and reads text or html attributes. To start with, I plan to watch some recap videos and re-read my old code, both linked below. I will practise in the file: dom.
        
    Fetch
        - I think I'm confusing the difference between fetch and using express. I need to recap the difference and make sure I'm comfortable with when to use each one. I will start my learning by watching some recap videos, and again, re-reading old code (linked below).
